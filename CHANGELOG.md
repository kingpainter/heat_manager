## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [0.3.6] — 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- **S-6** `sensor.py` — `RoomWindowDurationSensor` used `now.day` (1–31) as
  reset key, causing false midnight-resets on the same day-of-month in a
  different month. Changed to `now.date()`.
- **S-7** `websocket.py` — `_fmt_time()` contained hardcoded Danish string
  `"i går "`. Replaced with neutral `"%d/%m %H:%M"` format; panel JS handles
  locale-specific labels.
- **S-8** `websocket.py` + `__init__.py` — `_get_entry()` iterated all config
  entries and returned the first with `runtime_data`, which is wrong if two
  entries exist. Entry ID is now stored in `hass.data[DOMAIN]["entry_id"]` at
  setup; `_get_entry()` looks it up directly and only falls back to iteration.

### Changed
- **I-1** `sensor.py` — `EnergyWastedSensor` and `EnergySavedSensor` changed
  from `TOTAL_INCREASING` to `MEASUREMENT` state class. Both sensors reset at
  midnight; `TOTAL_INCREASING` caused HA Long-Term Statistics to log "dips"
  and raise warnings on every reset.
- **I-2** `coordinator.py` — Added `calendar_season` and `days_above_threshold`
  properties that proxy `season_engine` internals. `websocket.py` and
  `select.py` now use these instead of accessing `coordinator.season_engine.*`
  directly, reducing cross-layer coupling.

## [0.3.5] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **F4** `engine/valve_protection_engine.py` — New `ValveProtectionEngine`.
  Exercises every TRV valve once per ISO calendar week during a 02:00–03:00
  night window, but only when the controller is `OFF` (summer / manual off).
  Sends `set_temperature` to 28 °C (fully open), holds 30 s, then restores the
  original setpoint. Prefers HomeKit entity (local, <100 ms) over cloud entity.
  Staggered with `NETATMO_API_CALL_DELAY_SEC` for Netatmo rooms. Registered in
  coordinator tick and shutdown.
- **F6** `binary_sensor.py` — New `MoldRiskSensor` per room. Active when
  relative humidity ≥ 70 % and room temperature ≤ dewpoint + 1 °C surface
  margin (DIN 4108-2 simplified). Dewpoint calculated via Magnus formula
  (Lawrence 2005). Requires `CONF_HUMIDITY_SENSOR` to be set for a room.
  Exposes `humidity_pct`, `room_temp_c`, `dewpoint_c`, `margin_c` as
  extra state attributes. Device class `moisture`.
- **F5** `config_flow.py` — Per-person `preheat_lead_time_min` was already
  stored and read per-person by `PreheatEngine._lead_time_seconds()`; config
  flow selector max raised from 60 → 90 min to accommodate longer commutes.
- `const.py` — Added `CONF_HUMIDITY_SENSOR` constant with docstring.

### Changed
- `config_flow.py` — Room schema gains `humidity_sensor` text field (sensor.*
  — relative humidity in %). Appears in both setup wizard and options flow
  room-add step.
- `coordinator.py` — `ValveProtectionEngine` instantiated, ticked, and shut
  down alongside existing engines.

---

## [0.3.4] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- `frontend/heat-manager-panel.js` — Cloud status banner. Detects Netatmo
  cloud outages by inspecting HA climate entity `state` (unavailable/unknown)
  and `last_updated` staleness (≥ 10 min). Two modes: "Netatmo cloud
  utilgængelig" (all entities unavailable) and "Netatmo data forsinket" (stale
  data). Includes ✕ dismiss button (session-scoped). No external HTTP calls —
  uses only HA state machine data already available in the panel.
  Links to `health.netatmo.com` when all entities are unavailable.

---

## [0.3.3] — 2026-04-21

### Changed
- `panel.py` — registers `heat_manager_logo1.png` as static HTTP path at
  `/api/heat_manager-logo` with `cache_headers=True`.
- `frontend/heat-manager-panel.js` — `.header-icon` CSS rewritten to use
  `url("/api/heat_manager-logo")` instead of inline base64 JPEG. Fixes shadow
  DOM rendering in Chrome/Safari.

### Removed
- `frontend/heat-manager-panel.js` — "Energi i dag" overview section removed.
  WasteCalculator engine and energy sensors are unchanged; weekly bar chart on
  Rooms tab still works.

### Added
- `frontend/heat_manager_logo1.png` — 44 KB radiator logo.

---

## [0.3.2] — 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- **B-429-RESTORE-RACE** `presence_engine.py` — `_restore_all_schedule()`
  lacked re-entrancy guard; concurrent callers produced N×rooms Netatmo API
  calls and reliable HTTP 429 errors. Fixed with `_restore_lock`.
- **B-LOG-RESTORE-SPAM** `presence_engine.py` — Per-room NORMAL idempotency
  check prevents repeated WARNING logs from concurrent restore callers.
- Stale version strings in `manifest.json` and `const.py` corrected.

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **B-CARD-IAH** `heat-manager-card.js` — Invalid `?.replaceWith?.()` syntax
  and `insertAdjacentHTML` on ShadowRoot in card picker dialog.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-28

### Changed
- Complete visual redesign of panel and card. Ports Indeklima design system:
  DM Sans + DM Mono, `section-box` card anatomy, SVG ring component,
  chip/badge system, deep-dark palette with CSS custom properties.
  Heat semantics palette: amber for On, yellow for Pause, red for window/waste,
  teal for pre-heat.

---

## [0.2.9] — 2026-03-28

### Added
- `CONF_CO2_SENSOR` per-room — CO₂-aware window notifications and 50 % waste
  reduction when ventilation is justified.
- `CONF_ROOM_TEMP_SENSOR` per-room — external probe for PID feedback.
- `CONF_OUTDOOR_TEMP_SENSOR` global — local sensor overrides weather entity.

---

## [0.2.8] — 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- **B-CONFIG-2** Optional entity selectors reject empty strings; switched to
  text selectors for `homekit_climate_entity` and `pi_demand_entity`.
- **B-429** `asyncio.sleep(0.6)` stagger between rooms in `_set_all_away()`
  and `_restore_all_schedule()`.
- **B-PANEL-ENTITY-ID** Panel entity IDs resolved by suffix scan, not hardcoded.
- **B-PANEL-RAF** `requestAnimationFrame` → `setTimeout(0)`.

---

## [0.2.7] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- `CONF_TRV_TYPE` per-room — `netatmo` vs `zigbee` routing in presence,
  window, and preheat engines.
- `CONF_PI_DEMAND_ENTITY` per-room — dedicated Z2M `pi_heating_demand` sensor.

---

## [0.2.6] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- `CONF_HOMEKIT_CLIMATE_ENTITY` per-room — local HomeKit write channel for PID.
- `CONF_ROOM_WATTAGE` per-room — real kWh calculation via `heating_power_request`.

---

## [0.2.5] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- `_async_pid_tick()` in coordinator — PID setpoints written every 60 s.
- `tests/test_pid_tick.py` — 12 tests.

---

## [0.2.4] — 2026-03-27

### Added
- `engine/pid_controller.py` — discrete-time PI(D) with anti-windup and
  `power_to_setpoint()` mapper.
- `tests/test_pid_controller.py` — 24 tests.

---

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **B5/B6/B7** `panel.js` — WebKit `ShadowRoot.insertAdjacentHTML` crash,
  ON-button blink, persistent blink from concurrent renders.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-21

### Added
- `engine/season_engine.py`, `engine/waste_calculator.py`,
  `engine/preheat_engine.py`. Diagnostics, icons, HACS, full translations.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-20

### Added
- Initial release. All engines, config flow, platform entities, frontend
  panel and card, English + Danish translations, 36 tests.
